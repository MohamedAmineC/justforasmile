                        Education is fundamental throughout life and as said Jhon Dewey: "Education is not preparation of life.Education is life itself.". Recently, Kenya has made a lot of 
                        progress but how many children don't have access to school? How many children cannot afford high-school that is not free? As you see the problem is far from solved. </p>
                        <p>
                        For this reason, Just for a smile is leading a great mission. We are trying as possible as we can to build schools and to bring modern materials to all kenya's schools to grant better access for these youngsters, to give access to quality education,
                        to also provide students lacking financial means in Kenya with scolarships as well as to provide support and educational ressources for them to improve their lives and their communities. </p>
                        <p>
                        With this simple decision, by better education we will give the ability to all the kenyans to read and write like everybody, the ability to develop critical thinking,
                        and to learn new langages throught the education process. It's the way that will allow these children to develop their skills, to show their talent and to provide them with a social life
                        by meeting others and interacting with different people to exchange ideas and knowledge and share time with like-minded individuals. </p>
                        <p>
                        Education is a powerful force for prommoting opportunity
                        and growth. Everyone has their chance and also they deserve it to change their country and the world by their talent, they deserve to be what they want to be and to be theirselves. They will be responsible of a world of peace, justice, freedom and equality?
                        They just need the same opportunities granted to everyone else. What is life for them without education ? It looks like a life without future, a life without hope and like a mother without her son.
                        So, together, gathered until the end as one, we will deliver a smile to all boys and girls and we will give them the taste of life.
